# AI-powered-Content-Generator-via-RAG-Ollama
AI System to help automate document production based on templates for a law firm, Canada. We have started with Ollama / RAG
--------------------------------------
Building an AI system to automate document production based on templates for a law firm can be a highly beneficial tool to improve efficiency, accuracy, and consistency. Given that you're starting with Ollama and RAG (Retrieval-Augmented Generation), this approach can help generate legal documents based on predefined templates while retrieving relevant legal precedents or context from documents or databases.

Here's a high-level approach to building such a system:
Key Components

    Document Templates: These are predefined structures or skeletons for various legal documents (e.g., contracts, agreements, legal notices). You can store them in a database or as files.

    RAG System: A Retrieval-Augmented Generation (RAG) model can pull relevant context from existing legal precedents or past documents. This can be done by querying a database of past cases, legal articles, or other sources of relevant information.

    AI Model (Ollama): Ollama is a local LLM (large language model), which can be used to process the input, fill in the blanks, and generate text using both the template and context retrieved by the RAG system.

    User Interface: A user interface (UI) to allow the lawyer or legal assistant to select a template, input data, and view the generated document.

Workflow Overview

    The user selects a template from a set of predefined templates (e.g., NDA, partnership agreement).
    The user provides input data (e.g., client name, date, legal terms).
    The system uses RAG to retrieve relevant legal precedents or documents from the firm’s database.
    Ollama is used to process the input data and combine it with the template to generate a legally-sound document.
    The generated document is reviewed and finalized by the user.

Below is an example implementation of this system:
Step 1: Setting Up the Environment

You will need the following Python libraries:

    Ollama (for AI-based text generation).
    FAISS (for efficient retrieval of relevant documents, useful for your RAG setup).
    OpenAI GPT (or another LLM API) for document completion.
    Flask/Django (for web interface, if needed).
    Pandas/SQLite (to manage templates and legal database).

First, install necessary libraries:

pip install ollama faiss-cpu openai pandas flask

Step 2: Setup the Retrieval-Augmented Generation (RAG) System

In RAG, the retrieval process helps find documents, case law, or other legal references based on a query. FAISS (Facebook AI Similarity Search) is one of the most commonly used tools for this.

Here’s how you can set up the RAG component to search and retrieve relevant documents.
Example: RAG with FAISS

import faiss
import numpy as np
from ollama import Ollama

# Sample function to encode text to vectors (using a pre-trained embedding model)
def encode_text(texts):
    # This could be a call to OpenAI's embeddings API or another model
    # For demonstration, we'll use random vectors
    return np.random.rand(len(texts), 512).astype('float32')

# Example legal case documents to index
legal_documents = [
    "Case 1: The plaintiff in this case seeks damages for breach of contract.",
    "Case 2: A legal dispute regarding non-compete clauses in employment contracts.",
    "Case 3: A case involving intellectual property infringement."
]

# Create FAISS index
dimension = 512  # The dimension of the embedding vectors
index = faiss.IndexFlatL2(dimension)

# Generate embeddings for the documents
embeddings = encode_text(legal_documents)

# Add embeddings to the index
index.add(embeddings)

# Function to retrieve the most relevant documents from the database
def retrieve_relevant_documents(query):
    query_embedding = encode_text([query])  # Get embedding for the query
    _, indices = index.search(query_embedding, k=3)  # Retrieve top 3 documents
    return [legal_documents[i] for i in indices[0]]

# Example usage
query = "What are the legal considerations for a non-compete agreement?"
relevant_documents = retrieve_relevant_documents(query)
print("Relevant documents:", relevant_documents)

Step 3: Using Ollama to Generate Document Content

Now that we have a retrieval mechanism (RAG) to find relevant content, we can use Ollama to combine that with a document template to generate the full document.
Example: Document Generation using Ollama

from ollama import Ollama

# Initialize Ollama model
ollama_model = Ollama(model="llama2")  # Assuming you have Ollama setup

# Example template for an NDA agreement
nda_template = """
This Non-Disclosure Agreement ("Agreement") is made and entered into on {date}, by and between {party1} ("Disclosing Party") and {party2} ("Receiving Party").

1. Confidential Information: The Disclosing Party agrees to disclose confidential information to the Receiving Party, including but not limited to {confidential_info}.
2. Obligations: The Receiving Party agrees not to disclose or use the confidential information for any purpose other than {purpose}.
3. Duration: This agreement will be in effect from {start_date} to {end_date}.

Signed,
{disclosing_party_name}
"""

# Function to generate document by filling the template
def generate_document(template, input_data):
    # Fill in the template with user-provided data
    filled_template = template.format(**input_data)

    # Get additional relevant context via RAG (e.g., relevant case law)
    case_law = retrieve_relevant_documents(input_data["confidential_info"])

    # Combine the filled template with relevant case law using Ollama
    prompt = f"{filled_template}\n\nRelevant Legal Precedents: {case_law}\n\nGenerate a complete, professional NDA document."
    
    # Generate the document using Ollama
    response = ollama_model.chat(prompt)
    return response['text']

# Example user input
input_data = {
    "date": "2024-11-19",
    "party1": "Company A",
    "party2": "Company B",
    "confidential_info": "business strategies and trade secrets",
    "purpose": "evaluation of a potential partnership",
    "start_date": "2024-11-19",
    "end_date": "2025-11-19",
    "disclosing_party_name": "Company A"
}

# Generate the NDA document
generated_document = generate_document(nda_template, input_data)
print(generated_document)

This script:

    Retrieves relevant legal precedents or case law.
    Fills out the NDA template using user-provided input.
    Uses Ollama to generate a completed legal document by combining the template with the retrieved case law and other context.

Step 4: User Interface (Optional)

If you want a web interface to allow users to input data and generate documents, you can use Flask to set up a simple web app.
Example: Flask Interface

from flask import Flask, render_template, request

app = Flask(__name__)

@app.route('/')
def index():
    return render_template('index.html')

@app.route('/generate', methods=['POST'])
def generate():
    # Get user input from form
    input_data = {
        "date": request.form['date'],
        "party1": request.form['party1'],
        "party2": request.form['party2'],
        "confidential_info": request.form['confidential_info'],
        "purpose": request.form['purpose'],
        "start_date": request.form['start_date'],
        "end_date": request.form['end_date'],
        "disclosing_party_name": request.form['disclosing_party_name']
    }
    
    # Call the document generation function
    generated_document = generate_document(nda_template, input_data)
    
    return render_template('result.html', document=generated_document)

if __name__ == '__main__':
    app.run(debug=True)

In the index.html form, users can input the necessary data (party names, dates, etc.), and the result will be shown on a result.html page.
Step 5: Deploy and Test

    Deploy the System: Once tested locally, deploy the Flask app to a server or cloud provider like AWS, Heroku, or Azure.
    Add More Templates: Add more legal document templates (e.g., partnership agreements, service contracts, etc.) to the system and build corresponding input forms.
    Improve RAG: As your database of legal precedents and cases grows, the RAG system can be fine-tuned to become more accurate over time.

Conclusion

This system combines template-based document production with AI-powered content generation (via Ollama and RAG). It retrieves relevant legal context using RAG, generates a professional legal document using templates, and can be expanded to handle various types of legal documents. With further fine-tuning, this tool can greatly improve document automation in a law firm setting.
